# WikiTools
Minecraft mod to copy NBT, render entities and other things.
When Advanced Tooltips are enabled, the Skyblock ID will be shown in the item's tooltip.

To add items to the Copied Entity, press the Copy Entity key when hovering over an item. Armours will automatically go onto the entity, and holding shift when over a block will put it on its head.
